# QUBIES
An iOS game utilizing soft-body physics. Use your fingers to knock all QUBIES off the top of the screen to advance levels, but make sure to move quickly as new QUBIES are continuously spawning!

Written in C++ using openFrameworks for iOS.


This is an iOS project! Not sure if you need to do anything special, I think it will let you run it in your choice of the iPhone or iPad simulators without much hassle.
